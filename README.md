# Verge-Ruby
Verge-Ruby is a gem that makes it easy to work with Verge in ruby.

## Dependencies

The only requirement is a running Verge daemon ([verged](https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge)). Make sure to check out the [doc section](https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge/tree/master/doc) and follow the instructions for your os.
NOTICE: by default verged will only allow local connections.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'verge_client'

Or install it yourself as: (coming soon)

    $ gem install verge_client (coming soon)

## Configuration

If you're using rails you can create an initializer. Here are the default settings:

```ruby
# config/initializers/verge_client.rb
VERGEClient.configure do |config|
    config.host = 'localhost'
    config.port = 20102
    config.protocol = :http
    config.user = ''
    config.password = ''
end
```

You can also pass config variables as an options hash when creating a new client:

```ruby
client = VERGEClient.new(user: 'my_verged_username', password: 'my_super_secure_password')
```

## Example Usage

```ruby
# create a new instance of the client
client = VERGEClient.new

# check that verged is running and that our credentials are correct
if client.valid?
    # get a new wallet address
    new_wallet_addr = client.get_new_address

    # get the balance of our new wallet
    my_balance = client.get_balance(new_wallet_addr)
    puts "I have #{my_balance} XVG!"
else
    puts 'Something is wrong...'
end
```

## Can't I just use a client for bitcoin or litecoin?

Perhaps, but this way you don't need to worry about any current or future api inconsistencies.
